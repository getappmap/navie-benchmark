### Title
Remove HTML-style comments from Python code during test case generation in Gemini

### Problem
In the test case files generated by Gemini, there is an occurrence of HTML-style comments being included within Python code fences. This results in invalid Python code because Python does not support HTML-style comments.

### Analysis
The problem arises because the generation process is including metadata about the file location as an HTML-style comment within the fenced Python code block. Since this HTML comment is not valid Python syntax, it needs to be removed once the code is extracted from the fenced block.

The objective is to ensure that any HTML-style comments are stripped out from the beginning of the file, specifically after extracting code from the fenced block generated by Gemini. This will render the Python code valid and executable.

### Proposed Changes
1. **Test Case Generation Module**: Identify the component or function responsible for processing or generating the fenced Python code block. This is likely a part of the test case generation workflow within the Gemini related components.

2. **Modify Content Extraction Logic**: 
   - Update the logic that processes the contents of code fences to recognize HTML-style comments.
   - Implement a filter that checks for lines starting with `<!--` and ignore these lines when extracting and formatting the Python code.

3. **Ensure Python Validity**: 
   - After removing HTML comments, ensure that the remaining content is valid Python code.
   - Consider implementing a simple syntax check as an extra step to catch any residual format issues.

4. **Additional Verification**:
   - Implement unit tests that run through the test case generation process, providing cases with HTML-style comments and validating that the output does not include these comments.

By implementing these changes, we will ensure that the Python files generated by the tool are free of HTML-style comments and valid for execution.
