The `collect_appmap_context` function systematically parses AppMap data files to gather and compile context information about the codebase. Specifically, it:

1. **Extracts Locations**: It reads the AppMap data to identify and list all code locations where functions and methods are defined.
   
2. **Retrieves Source Code**: For each identified location, it attempts to retrieve the corresponding source code by reading the file and extracting the function or method code using line numbers provided in the AppMap data.

3. **Logs Errors**: It logs any issues encountered during processing, such as missing line numbers or non-existent files.

4. **Aggregates Results**: The function accumulates the collected code snippets into a dictionary that maps file locations (formatted as "file:line") to the retrieved source code, allowing further analysis or usage.

The function is part of a larger workflow where it interacts with processes that generate AppMap data, such as test runs, and provides input to subsequent tools or analyses that utilize the collected context information for purposes like code validation or refactoring.
