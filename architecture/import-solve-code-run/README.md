### Import Solve Code Run Feature

The "Import Solve Code Run" feature is designed to manage and handle data from solve runs, particularly focusing on importing test cases and generating patches from various sources. This feature facilitates the downloading, organizing, and archiving of test data and predictive results from runs performed locally or accessible through GitHub Workflow runs.

#### Key Components and Functionality

1. **Data Importation**:
   - The feature can handle data from either local directories or GitHub Workflow run IDs. This flexibility allows users to work with data stored in different environments.
   - It allows importing of test patches, solutions, and predictions into a structure suitable for further analysis and testing.

2. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - Through the command-line interface, users can specify whether to download data, create symbolic links for optimal test patches, or simply organize already downloaded data.
   - Essential arguments include `run_id` for GitHub runs, `solve_dir` for local directories, and `local_run_name` to identify local run archives.

3. **Artifact Management**:
   - The feature can archive local runs by creating standard archive files (`predictions.zip`, `solutions.zip`, `solve.zip`, `test-patch.zip`) that mimic GitHub Workflow artifacts.
   - Users can download artifacts from GitHub based on a `run_id`, ensuring that latest test data is accessible for analysis.

4. **Test Patch Handling**:
   - It ensures only optimal test patches are symlinked into the test patch directory, maintaining data integrity and avoiding redundancy.
   - Test patches are extracted from zipped artifacts and saved as JSON, making them easy to manipulate and consume for further processing.

5. **Environment Considerations**:
   - The feature checks for necessary environment variables such as `GITHUB_TOKEN`, ensuring secure and authenticated access to GitHub resources.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Clear error messages and exception handling ensure the user is informed about any issues during the import process, particularly with missing environment variables or invalid run IDs.

This feature integrates closely with the testing and validation workflows, providing a systematic approach to importing and organizing solve run data for efficient testing and evaluation.
