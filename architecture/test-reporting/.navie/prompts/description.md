/include=solver 

Describe the test reporting functionality. This functionality is encapsulated within the Report class, which generates a CSV report by consolidating data from evaluation results, solutions, and predictions. The class is initialized using paths to directories containing solution logs, evaluation logs, and predictions files. The core method, generate, collects and processes data from these sources, organizing it into a CSV format to provide insights into the solver's effectiveness. Emphasize the components involved, such as data collection, processing, and report generation, while illustrating how this feature supports evaluation of solution accuracy and performance.
