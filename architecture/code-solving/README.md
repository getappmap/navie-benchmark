## Feature: Code Solving

### Overview

The "Code Solving" feature is designed to automate the generation and optimization of code patches within a specified project. This feature systematically identifies test errors, formulates a plan to address them, and applies code modifications confined to specific files, without altering the testing infrastructure. The ultimate objective is to create an environment where code changes are seamless and optimized for the existing architecture, avoiding disruptions or errors.

### Functionality

1. **Error Analysis**: 
   - The code solver identifies and presents test errors that need addressing. A structured plan is generated outlining these errors and preventing test failures.

2. **Plan and Modify**:
   - A detailed plan is created for the necessary code modifications, restricting changes to explicitly mentioned files. This ensures that only the targeted areas of the codebase are altered, preserving the integrity of other components.

3. **Patch Generation**:
   - A new code patch is generated based on the specified plan. The code solver selects optimal code patches using mock functionalities to simulate and validate the generated code's effectiveness in resolving identified issues.

4. **Test Compatibility**:
   - Ensures compatibility with the test framework utilized, allowing seamless integration and execution of generated code patches using pre-defined command lines for testing. This maintains consistency across project environments.

5. **Execution**:
   - Utilizes Python's subprocess capabilities to execute commands related to instance sets and solve limits. This automation facilitates the smooth application of generated code patches across the codebase.

6. **Archiving Logs**:
   - After the code-solving process, logs for the applied patches and predictions are archived. This is instrumental in maintaining records of all code changes and predictions made during the process.

### Design Considerations

- **Environment-Specific Code**: 
  - The feature is designed to respect the constraints of the specific Python version used by the project, ensuring no incompatibilities or unsupported features are introduced in the codebase.

- **No Direct Testing Suggestions**:
  - The feature does not provide direct testing recommendations or alterations, as these considerations are handled in a separate step to maintain focus on code optimization.

- **User Interaction**: 
  - Minimal user intervention is required, other than initiating the code-solving process and inputting necessary parameters such as instance sets and context tokens.

Overall, the Code Solving feature offers a streamlined approach to code optimization within a project, facilitating automatic code patch creation and application while aligning with the existing architectural constraints and testing frameworks.
