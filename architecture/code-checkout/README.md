**Feature: Code Checkout**

The "Code Checkout" feature facilitates the creation of a local working copy of the code repository by leveraging a Docker container. This process involves exporting the current state of the version-controlled files from the container to the local file system, capturing the initial code baseline in a local git repository, and ensuring the code is set up for subsequent modifications and executions.

### Feature Overview

- **Container-Based Code Export**: The feature initiates by executing a command in a Docker container to create a compressed `.tar.gz` archive of the current state of the code. This archive is generated using the `git archive` command, emphasizing that the export is derived from a version-controlled git repository within the container.
  
- **Local Directory Setup**: Prior to extraction, the feature verifies that the designated local directory (`source_dir`) for extracting the code does not already exist. If it does, a `ValueError` is raised to prevent unintentional overwrites. The directory is created if it doesn't preexist.

- **Extraction Process**: The generated archive is copied from the container to the local file system. The content of the archive is then extracted into `source_dir`. This step ensures that the working directory is populated with the latest version-controlled code from the container environment.

- **Local Git Initialization**: After extraction, the feature performs a series of git commands within the local directory to initialize a new git repository. It adds all the extracted files to the staging area and performs an initial commit, labeling it as "Baseline commit". This establishes a baseline from which subsequent modifications can be tracked locally.

### Error Handling

The feature incorporates robust error handling to address potential issues during the checkout process:

- If a failure occurs during the git initialization and commit stages, the error is logged with details of the exception. This ensures transparency and ease of troubleshooting.
- Regardless of the operation outcome, the process guarantees that the system directory context is reset to its original state by using a `finally` block.

### Usage Context

This feature is a fundamental part of setting up the development workflow by ensuring that the source code is properly initialized with version control in the local environment after being exported from a controlled Docker container. This setup is particularly useful when working with remote environments, allowing developers to have a synchronized and consistent starting point for code development and testing on their local systems.
