* Test with Anthropic
* Remove step to list packages? Just report presence of test frameworks (pytest, unittest) to the solver?
* Increase context size on retries
* Run solver test suite in CI
* Continue to add code coverage
* Only request image build for instances that can't be pulled. It doesn't seem to check the cache.
  build_instance_images

  elif spec.instance_image_key not in existing_images:
      data_to_build.append(instance)


  print(f"Building instance images for {len(test_specs)} instances")
  successful, failed = list(), list()

* Continue to expand the built images

* "Code patch is not optimal" can be emitted when there is no successful edit test file

[generate-and-validate-code] (django__django-13658) Code patch is not optimal. Will look for a better patch.

* Why are instance images being rebuilt? No cacheable Dockerfile?

* Do not use the built-in timeout for run_evaluation, it's 1_800 seconds (30 minutes). Report evaluation timeout separately, so the instances can be re-run if desired.
