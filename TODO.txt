  build_instance_images

  elif spec.instance_image_key not in existing_images:
      data_to_build.append(instance)

  print(f"Building instance images for {len(test_specs)} instances")
  successful, failed = list(), list()

* Continue to expand the built images

* "Code patch is not optimal" can be emitted when there is no successful edit test file

[generate-and-validate-code] (django__django-13658) Code patch is not optimal. Will look for a better patch.
