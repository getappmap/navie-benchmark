This is a change from version 5.4.1, where skipped tests did not\n+   execute `tearDown`. This behavior can lead to unexpected errors if `tearDown` relies\n+   on setup that is not performed due to the test being skipped. It is recommended to\n+   review the release notes of subsequent `pytest` versions for any changes or fixes\n+   related to this issue. As a workaround, consider using conditional logic within\n+   `tearDown` to check if the test was actually executed.\n+\n Ignore paths during test collection\n -----------------------------------\n \n",
