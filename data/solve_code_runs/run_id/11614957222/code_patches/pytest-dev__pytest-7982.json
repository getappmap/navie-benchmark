Previously, pytest would unintentionally skip test collection\n+  from symlinked directories due to using ``follow_symlinks=False`` in the directory\n+  traversal code. Now symlinked directories are properly followed and their tests are\n+  collected and executed as expected.\n+\n - `#7758 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7758>`_: Fixed an issue where some files in packages are getting lost from ``--lf`` even though they contain tests that failed. Regressed in pytest 5.4.0.\n \n \n",
