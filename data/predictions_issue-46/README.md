## Predictions - Issue 46

Predictions for issues recovered due to accidental loss:

https://github.com/getappmap/navie-benchmark/pull/46

Predictions are written here by the script solver/find_dropped_optimal_patches.py

They are generated by taking the prediction from the solve run that reported the wrong
patch, and replacing the model_patch field with the correct patch.
